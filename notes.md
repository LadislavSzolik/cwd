## Where does software design belong?

Great architects build our physical world, software developers do the same thing for our virtual world.

However, often this world tries to convince us we are just here to write code like a cog in machine and incapable of
thinking about good design. An external consultant dictates how the software should look, this results in an awful
developer and user experience.

The problem is, some of us accept this reality and limit themselves. This make us feel sad and want to change this.

## Is this community for you?

We could not find a place where people come together, share their experiences and work on projects to level up. There
are many blogs, tutorials, forums and Udemy classes, but they seldom help us move forward. That is the reason why this
idea came.

This is not about self-promotion or disconnected discussion, but about connections, trust and progress towards a reality
where we take ownership of software making.

## Why projects?

Project based learning helps people focus on the key elements of software engineering, and it is also much more fun!
Shipping a real product to real users motivate us and help to be really pragmatic. You give feedback and you can get
feedback.

Where we are standing with this community? We are at the beginning of the journey. In the next step we want to design a
workshop. Nothing fancy. We need to define projects, timelines and the way we will interact with each other.

If this resonates with you, and you are either an experienced or aspiring software maker, come help us shape this
community.
